Their multimodal nature, however, presents unique challenges for automated classification systems. Traditional approaches that focus exclusively on either textual or visual analysis fall short of understanding the intricate interplay
between these modalities, often missing the subtle context and humor embedded in memes. As a result, developing robust systems capable of accurately interpreting and classifying memes requires integrating advanced techniques for both text and image analysis.","BALAJI T K","balajitk7@gmail.com","+918919192516","PhD",,,,,,,,,"https://youtu.be/xn8WoQtcYMc"
