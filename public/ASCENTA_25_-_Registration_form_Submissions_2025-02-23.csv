Their multimodal nature, however, presents unique challenges for automated classification systems. Traditional approaches that focus exclusively on either textual or visual analysis fall short of understanding the intricate interplay
between these modalities, often missing the subtle context and humor embedded in memes. As a result, developing robust systems capable of accurately interpreting and classifying memes requires integrating advanced techniques for both text and image analysis.","BALAJI T K","balajitk7@gmail.com","+918919192516","PhD",,,,,,,,,"https://youtu.be/xn8WoQtcYMc"

In modern road environments, nighttime driving remains a significant safety challenge. A major contributor to accidents is the temporary blindness (blackout effect) caused by high-beam headlights of oncoming vehicles. Additionally, road condition signs often go unnoticed, leading to increased risk for drivers.

Our Adaptive Smart Headlight & Intelligent Road Warning System is designed to revolutionize nighttime driving safety. This innovative system dynamically adjusts headlight intensity based on real-time traffic conditions, ensuring automatic dimming when an oncoming vehicle is detected—preventing glare-induced accidents. Additionally, it integrates intelligent road condition alerts, providing drivers with real-time notifications of critical signboards, enhancing situational awareness.

Key Features:
✔ Adaptive Headlight Control – Automatically dims headlights upon detecting an approaching vehicle to reduce glare and improve visibility for both drivers.
✔ Intelligent Road Sign Detection – Recognizes and communicates important road condition signs directly to the driver for enhanced awareness.
✔ Advanced Sensor Integration – Utilizes night vision cameras and LIDAR sensors for accurate vehicle detection and real-time adjustments.
✔ V2V Communication Ready – Future-proof design with potential for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) alerts to enhance cooperative driving safety.

By addressing the critical issue of high-beam glare and enhancing driver awareness through proactive road condition alerts, this system reduces accident risks and enhances road safety for all.","Jaynil Panjwani","jaynil.dp24@iiits.in","+917874202456","UG1",,,,,,,,,"https://youtu.be/JjviTDRkI-E?si=PTR3d7uTI7plWQOP"
