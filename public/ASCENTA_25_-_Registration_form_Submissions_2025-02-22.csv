Their multimodal nature, however, presents unique challenges for automated classification systems. Traditional approaches that focus exclusively on either textual or visual analysis fall short of understanding the intricate interplay
between these modalities, often missing the subtle context and humor embedded in memes. As a result, developing robust systems capable of accurately interpreting and classifying memes requires integrating advanced techniques for both text and image analysis.","BALAJI T K","balajitk7@gmail.com","+918919192516","PhD",,,,,,,,,"https://youtu.be/xn8WoQtcYMc"

The device is integrated into a pair of spectacles and uses computer vision, deep learning, and natural language processing to provide real-time assistance in recognizing faces, reading text, and describing surroundings. The system consists of a Raspberry Pi-based hardware setup, a mobile application (under development), and a robust audio feedback mechanism to communicate information to the user.

Key Benefits of Netradarshak’s Proposed Solutions
✅ All-in-One Assistive Device: Combines face recognition, OCR, and scene description into a single device.
✅ Real-Time Processing: Instant feedback to the user without significant delays.
✅ Hands-Free Operation: Wearable design allows continuous use without requiring manual input.
✅ AI-Powered: Uses advanced deep learning models for improved accuracy and adaptability.
✅ Customizable & Scalable: Future versions will include GPS integration and voice-command navigation.","Gogineni Naga Venkata Nihar Chowdary","nihargnv@gmail.com","+917093725382","UG2","Kandakatla Joseph Prem Kumar","josephkandakatla@gmail.com","+919392122287","UG2","D GopiNadh","gopinadhdupati@gmail.com","+919908274898","UG2","https://youtu.be/EAT9a-Z3Wy4"
